# APIs

## API is an acronym for "Application Programming Interface". 

It is a type of software interface that offers a service to other pieces of software. Using a restaurant setting as an example, the servers and waiters can be referred to as an API. Their job is to fetch from the kitchen (the backend/server) and deliver to the feeding area (front end).
